# Cookie Stand Tycoon

What good is being a Cookie Stand Tycoon if you've got no style?

## Overview

The previous web designer's side hussle just got bought out and they've decided to moved on before completing project.

The dreams of a well designed cookie stand administration site are crumbling!

The current site is functional but completely unstyled.

Do you think you have what it takes to get something serviceable whipped up this afternoon?

## Feature Tasks

The requirements are pretty loose. It just needs to look awesome, or at least pretty ok.

Here's a general idea, but please add as much pizzazz as you see fit.
